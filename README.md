# GlioGraphSeg

GlioGraphSeg is a deep learning-based framework for **brain tumor (glioma) segmentation from MRI scans**.  
It leverages **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to model spatial and structural relationships between image regions, enabling accurate and robust tumor delineation.

The project is designed for **medical image analysis**, combining graph-based representations with modern deep learning techniques.
